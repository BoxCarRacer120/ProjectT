                        <h3>Tools</h3>
                        <p>Tools are a loose association of items that are used to perform the various non-combat tasks involved in Terraria gameplay, such as construction and exploration, among others. Tools are generally wielded via the âš’ Use / Attack key while they are held as the active hotbar item; though they are differentiated from weapons, whose primary use is instead to inflict damage upon enemies. Tools are also differentiated from accessories, which provide passive abilities, while tools are used proactively.

                    <h4>Pickaxes and Drills</h4>
                    <p>Pickaxes and Drills are used to free placed blocks or furniture for collection. When used on blocks, this is often referred to as "mining" or "digging". Their tier determines which types of blocks they can mine, as well as the number of hits it takes to remove each block type (see Pickaxe and Drill for those details). Drills function identically to Pickaxes, but with an alternate animation and sound effect. All tools to the right and below (and including itself) of the Cobalt Drill are Hardmode, with one exception: users playing on the 3DS version version can obtain the Drax pre-hardmode by locating one in a Shadow Chest, provided they have a single Shadow Key. The player begins with the Copper Pickaxe when starting a new Classic character, and an Iron Pickaxe when starting a new Journey character.

                    <h4>Axes and chainsaws</h4>
                    <p>Axes and Chainsaws are used to harvest large plants like Trees, Cacti, and Giant Glowing Mushrooms (Wood blocks are removed with a pickaxe instead). Chainsaws function identically to Axes, but with an alternate animation and sound effect. Hamaxes function as both Axes and Hammers. The player begins with the Copper Axe when starting a new Classic character, and an Iron Axe when starting a new Journey character.

                <div class="hammers">
                    <h4>Hammers</h4>
                    <p>Hammers are used to free background walls for collection, to destroy background walls which cannot be collected, to shape foreground blocks to create slopes and half-tiles, and to shape platforms to create stairs. They are also used to destroy Shadow Orbs and Crimson Hearts. The Pwnhammer, Hammush, and The Axe can additionally be used in Hardmode to destroy Altars, which triggers the spawning of new Hardmode ores. Journey characters start with an Iron Hammer.
